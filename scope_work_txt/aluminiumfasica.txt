The importance of aluminum fascia:
Fascia plays an essential role in keeping your home watertight. Some fascia material may not provide enough coverage, 
which will allow water to seep into your home. Aluminum fascia, on the other hand,
will provide an impermeable barrier, meaning your home will stay nice and dry in even the worst storms.
